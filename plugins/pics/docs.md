## Plugin Details

This plugin retrieves pictures for actors, scenes, movies or studios
- You can configure an array of search configurations for every type.
- Each search configuration allows for searching for a single type of image.
- You may have multiple configurations of the same `'prop'`, to act as fallbacks if the previous configuration for that type had no results.
- - Only the last image found for a given `'prop'` will be created.

> Note: the example only shows a single search configuration for every type of item, but you can add as little or as many as you want
